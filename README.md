# Hi there 👋

### I'm Bolade, a front end developer based in Lagos, Nigeria

As a front end developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail to make things I believe will change the world. 

Below are the tools I use

```
Javascript ❤
```
```
Typescript 🔥
```

```
React 😍
```
```
Angular 😎
```
```
NodeJs 😏
```

```
ChakraUI 😊
```

Do not Invade the repositiories. For therein lies stashes and batches of half written projects. 🤣🤣

## ⚡ Fun fact
When I'm not coding, I'm Cooking.
